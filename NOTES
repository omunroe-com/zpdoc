Quick notes, need to be expanded:

Download a wikipedia file from http://static.wikipedia.org, use 7zip to unextract it (7z x wikipedia-id-html.7z or 7za x wikipedia-id-html.7z). 
Then run ruby zdump.rb id id.zdump - zdump.rb must be ran from the catalogue where all the rb scripts are. id is the catalogue where you unzipped the Wikipedia file, and id.zdump is the resulting file.
To use any zdump file, use ruby mongrel-web.rb id.zdump, yout can then access pages from localhost:2042 (or 127.0.0.1:2042 if that doesn't work).
In zdump.rb there is a line called ignore = /something/ - this is a regular expression of pages to ignore. If you take out discussion, talk and image pages, usually you can make the resulting file about 40% smaller.

mongrel-web-gui.rb is currently completely out of date, but it should be easy to fix it. All development happens in ruby-web.rb (maybe the should be merged).

Please contact me with any questions.
